# WHY #

Action at a distance - let's start at the atomic level

[Computer engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering)


### ATOMIC ###

![Electron](/assets/electron.png)

- The world we live in is a sea of electrons. What we call electricity is just the movement of electrons.
- How to grab using magnets
- Causes a electron pressure


### LIKE WATER ###
[Hydraulic analogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_analogy)

Electricity and the way we utilize it can be conceptualized similarly to the way modern society manages and moves water.
- Pipes = Wires
- Water Tower = Capacitor
- Dam-Constraints = Resistor
- Valve/Variable = Resistor
- Circuit
  - Drains the source of water, so it needs a return path; circuits always need two wires back to source one supply and one drain. + and -
  - In electronics, "-" is source and drain is "+". Negative flows to positive.
- In electronics, this all runs at once
- flush two toilets
- different pressures based on valves or constraints
- networks become complicated


### MEASURING ###

- Volts
  - ball dropping, potential energy
  - between two points
  - use V as symbol, measures volts
- Amps
  - size of ball
  - use I as symbol, measures amps
- Watts
  - unitized measure of power
  - W=IV
- Ohms
  - not a perfect world, has resistance
  - ohms law. I=V/R : [Ohm's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law)
  - use R as symbol, measures resistance

### INTEGRATED CIRCUITS - IC ###

[Integrated circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit)

- Transistor - Cow grade example
  - if one or two cows would lay down on grate. All the other cows could cross
  - variable flow. when grate is four cows wide. if whole gate is covered then all the cows move. If only half covered then half move
  - cows represents electrons. electrons like water drain. So new analogy
-  if these cows where trying to cross a piraña filled stream at a gate that was three cows wide. Continue to sacrifice one to three cows and they can cross at respective percentages. But stop sacrificing cows and the flow stops
- emitter (new field), collector (cows), base (grate)
- there are holes in the gate that drain. continue sprinkling electrons to cover the holes and the electrons at the collector can cross to the emitter at respective percentages
- allows a variable current to flow from collector to emitter based on percentage of gate coverage
- uses NPN or PNP
- Diode - NP example
- electrons repel other electrons. with a diode the source electrons can cover the holes if current is flowing in one direction. And repel the electrons in the hole, cause a wider gap if the electrons flow in the opposite direction
  - makes a one way valve. Unless too much pressure then gate jumps anyways

### IC PRODUCTION ###

- Semi-conductor means add or subtract to change it.
- Silicon because its semi-conductor
- Silicon rod process
- Sanding/polish
- Screen print
  - use photo-resist and light
  - bulk can get changed to N or P
  - bake for oxide or coat w metal
  - acid etch
  - rinse to clean
  - repeat
- Because flat like the interstates, if two wires need to cross they have to take a bridge, go up a layer and back down
- Modern have like 40 metal layers

### EXAMPLE ###

- sound is push and pull on cone. Let say plus is push and minus is pull;
- wire with plus and minus voltage makes sound wave;
- bridge rectifier. four diodes. splits two two paths. One for plus and one for minus;
- connect those to two transistors and create a push pull amplifier.
- large voltage at both collectors. Inputs at each gate and both emitters connected. outputs original sound wave as a larger but scaled version of the original. amplified;

### DIGITAL ABSTRACTION ###

- Real world is called analog
- To complicated to work in.
- Make simplified model where no such thing as voltage or amperage or resistance or heat or - defects etc. exist. only two states ON and OFF. Or 0 and 1 respectively.
- Rules that translate digital to analog because we still exist in analog world
- Lets say 0.0-0.25 volts is OFF and 0.45-1.0 is ON
- Each circuit is up to three hops away from power source. So we don't get pressure loss going through too many circuits
