## DIGITAL ENGINES ##

### ASIC ###

Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC).

- Lots of different IC made.
- Analogy IC like a house, skyscraper, or city depending on size. 
- Build a house and can't change it easily. But works great for specific application. Everything runs in realtime.

### Primary Dynamic Types ###

ASICs or Application Specific Integrated Circuits will continue to exist. But in order to add a dynamic component there exists three main branches. 
CPU, GPGPU, and FPGA.

#### CPU ####
After building a lot of houses, one realizes they are basically made up of bathrooms bedrooms kitchens and living rooms.

Sacrifice realtime and only use one room at a time, and you could build a meta house. With one bathroom, one bed room, one kitchen, and one living room. Add another room to sequence these. And a stream of bytes to tell u which room to use next. And u get virtually any combination of house you want with out having to rebuild.

This is what a microprocessor does. The rest is just trying to structure my house to be most efficient at using the rooms. Or predicting what will happen.

#### GPGPU ####
Different way of structuring the silicon.

In a CPU to paint a house white. You would have one guy paint every surface. GPU operations are usually redundant dividing up a screen lets say into 64 smaller screens. And performing an action on all 64 at one time. A GPU painting a house would have 64 guys, one for each wall that needs to be painted and each painting just their wall.

#### FPGA ####
A different approach.

Since logic gates are really just a table of ones and zeros with a result. Millions of tiny programmable elements which make virtual logic gates. And a way to programmatically interconnect them. Makes a ASIC that is dynamic. And runs in realtime. Sort of the best of both worlds.


### ISA ###
In each of these platforms there a language to program it. Also sometimes refered to as its ISA.

for a CPU for instance

```
MOV AX, 13h
MOV BX, 2
REPZ STOSW
```
