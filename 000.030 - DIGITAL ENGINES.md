DIGITAL ENGINES
Lots of different IC made.
Analogy IC like a house. 
Build a house and can't change it easily. But works great for specific application. Everything runs in realtime.

ASICs or Application Specific Integrated Circuits will continue to exist. But in order to add a dynamic component there exists three main branches. 

CPU, GPGPU, and FPGA.

CPU
After building a lot of houses. One realizes they are basically made up of bathrooms bedrooms kitchens and living rooms.
Sacrifice realtime and use only one room at a time. And u could build a meta house. With one bathroom, one bed room, one kitchen, and one living room. Add another room to sequence these. And a stream of bytes to tell u which room to use next. And u get virtually any combination of house you want with out having to rebuild.

This is what a microprocessor does. The rest is just trying to structure my house to be most efficient at using the rooms. Or predicting what will happen.

GPGPU
Different way of structuring the silicon. In a CPU to paint a house white. U would have one guy paint every surface. GPU operations are usually redundant dividing up a screen lets say into 64 smaller screens. And performing an action on all 64 at one time. A GPU painting a house would have 64 guys , one for each wall that needs to be painted and each painting just their wall.

FPGA
A different approach. Since logic gates are really just a table of ones and zeros with a result. Millions of tiny programmable elements which make virtual logic gates. And a way to programmatically interconnect them. Makes a ASIC that is dynamic. And runs in realtime. Sort of the best of both worlds.
