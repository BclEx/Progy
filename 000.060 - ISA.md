ISA - INSTRUCTION LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

CPU - Central Processing Unit

a cpu is considered a load/store machine. It can only remember a few things. so it contantly needs to load from memory, preform an action, and store the result back to memory.



MEMORY

memory is broken into L1-L4 which is on the cpu, and system memory which is off the cpu.

L1-L4 are for the cpu data cache stream which represents a small amount of of cached system memory

system memory is made up of a large phyical address space. and sub-divided into logical memory spaces using segment registers below.

segment:offset so i can move my logical memory around on the phyical memory.

CS - code segment
DS - data segment
ES - extra segment
SS - stack segment
FS - ignore
GS - ignore

the cpu registry file represents the small amount of data that the cpu can remember at any one time.
note: the segment registers and a few others are included in this.

GENERAL PURPOSE
AX - accumulator
BX - base
CX - count
DX - data

the general ones are broken down into High and Low
AH and AL respectivly.
or DH and DL for DX register

AH - upper 16bits
AL - lower 16bits
AX - 32bits
EAX - 64bits

COPY/COMPARE
SI - source index
DI - destination index

STACK
SP - stack pointer
BP - base pointer

SPECIAL
IP - instruction pointer
FL - flags


mov ax, 4
mov ax, [4]
mov bx, 4
mov ax, [bx]
mov ax, [bx + 1]
mov [bx + 1], ax

add ax, 1
inc ax
dec ax
mul ax, 4
div ax, 4

call
ret
jmp

cmp ax, 3
jz - jump if zero
je - jump if equal
jg - jump if greater then
jt - jump if less then
jnz - jump if zero
jne - jump if equal
jng - jump if greater then
jnt - jump if less then

pop
push



STACK
stack is a way to store values on the "memory stack" pointed to by SS:ESP.
push 3 - adds the number three to the stack
pop ax - returns the number three from the stack into the ax register
