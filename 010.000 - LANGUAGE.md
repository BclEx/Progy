## LANGUAGE ##

computers don't understand our language, see everything as big streams of numbers.

## TOKENIZE ##
into continuous tokens of characters breaking on whitespace

```
1.234 sky morey;
--- becomes ---
number: 1.234
string: sky
string: morey
string: ;
```

sometimes we want to represent a token with the space retained, use quotes

```
"sky morey";
--- becomes ---
string: sky morey
```

this becomes an issue if we want to also represent a " in a token. then we get into escaping.

```
"sky \"morey\" was here";
--- becomes ---
string: sky "morey" was here
string: ;
```

escape characters and encoding sequences are based on the language. usualy a special character for escape, but then you have to escape the escape \ -> \\

c, c++, c#, javascript:
```
\\ = \
\" = quote
"" = quote (.net if not @"")
\n = return
\t = tab
```

javascript:
```
string, single quote or double quote. 'string' or "string"
```

SQL:
```
string, single quote or double quote. 'string' or "string"

encoding: [Symbol]

```

Esc | Character Represented by Sequence
-- | --
\0 | An ASCII NUL (X'00') character
\' | A single quote (') character
\" | A double quote (") character
\b | A backspace character
\n | A newline (linefeed) character
\r | A carriage return character
\t | A tab character
\Z | ASCII 26 (Control+Z); see note following the table
\\ | A backslash (\) character
\% | A % character; see note following the table
\_ | A _ character; see note following the table


## LEXICON ##

this is where the compiler or instruction handler applys meaning to the stream of tokens recieved, based on the syntax of the language.

based on the language the compiler will understand the syntax, or throw a syntax error.

SQL:
```
Select MyField
From MyTable
Where MyField = 'MyValue';
```

c, c++:
```
int age = 10;
printf("%d\n", age);
```

HTML:
```
<a href="value">text</a>
```

CSS:
```
.small { background: solid black }
```

## HIGH LEVEL ##

high level languages have added additional features

**Macro expansion** - Macro expansion is always just a textual transform of the input source code. You should be able to see the code after the pre-processor (the part of the compilation that does the macro expansion) is done; this text is what the compiler proper then works on.

c, c++:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#define foo bar
#if VALUE
#endif
```

**String interpolation** - In computer programming, string interpolation (or variable interpolation, variable substitution, or variable expansion) is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values.

c#:
```
var age = 3;
var string = $"my {age}";
```

javascript:
```
let age = 3;
let string = `my ${age}`;
```
