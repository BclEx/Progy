## SQL I - BASIC ## 

Prerequisites: [DATA](000.010+-+DATA), [DATA SHAPE](000.011+-+DATA+SHAPE), [LANGUAGE](010.000+-+LANGUAGE).

Glossary:
  - Technical debt - the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
  - RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
  - CRUD - Create Read Update Delete
  - ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
  - DDL - Data Definition Language : CREATE, ALTER
  - DML - Data Manipulation Language : INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  - DCL* - Data Control Language : GRANT, REVOKE

## LIGHT DATA STRUCTURES ##

**BINARY TREE** - left, right pointers

**BTREE** - many pointers


## CONTEXT ##

From scratch using data structures, adds technical debt.

What about
- Recoverability - Backup and Restore
- Efficiency - Faster data access
- Volatility and Scale - Rollbacks, Federation
- Concurrency - multiple threads concurently accessing same data
- Durability - Power outages in middle of operation
- Plasticity - Change the schema

Wrapped into a middle ware, that can be reused and bring these forward. Deployed as an in-process component, or server.

## INTERFACE ##

Need a way to inteface with SQL, In-Proc or Server:

* **MDAC** - Microsoft Data Access Components is a framework of interrelated Microsoft technologies that allows programmers a uniform and comprehensive way of developing applications that can access almost any data store.

* **SQL Native Client** - can be used rather than Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) to create new applications or enhance existing applications that need to take advantage of new SQL Server 2005 features such as Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS), Query Notifications, User-Defined Types (UDT), and XML data type support.

  * **TDS** - Specifies the Tabular Data Stream Protocol, which is an application layer request/response protocol that facilitates interaction with a database server and provides for authentication and channel encryption negotiation; specification of requests in SQL (including Bulk Insert); invocation of a stored procedure, also known as a Remote Procedure Call (RPC); returning of data; and Transaction Manager Requests.
    - Single command
    - Recordset
    - Print

* **ODBC** - Open Database Connectivity is a standard application programming interface for accessing database management systems. The designers of ODBC aimed to make it independent of database systems and operating systems.

## PERMISSIONS ##

* Server role permissions
* object permissions
* role level permisions are done using view or functions

## SCHEMA ##

* **dbo**, database owner
* ***anything else***, custom schemas

## DATABASE ##

## TABLE ##

## VIEW ##


## DDL ##

Data Definition Language (DDL) is a standard for commands that define the different structures in a database. DDL statements create, modify, and remove database objects such as tables, indexes, and users. Common DDL statements are CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

**CREATE**, **ALTER**, used to add or modify existing objects

```
CREATE TABLE dbo.Board(
  BoardId int NOT NULL,
  Title nvarchar(300) NULL,
  CONSTRAINT [PK_Board] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (BoardId ASC),
)
```

**DROP**, used to drop existing objects
```
DROP TABLE dbo.Board
```

## DML ##

DML is abbreviation of Data Manipulation Language. It is used to retrieve, store, modify, delete, insert and update data in database. Examples: SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT statements. DDL is abbreviation of Data Definition Language. It is used to create and modify the structure of database objects in database.

* SQL is a set language
Set like the army, instead of a recipe

Set types:
- inner
- outer
- left
- right
- full join
- cross join
- cross apply

Select
- Into
- Streams records
- Acts like a whole seperate part of query
- Can have sub querys
- Can select into variables
- Top
- From
- Join joins tables together
- Group A grouping clause
- Having Second Where

Insert
- single value, or select
- output

Delete
- Can join, but dangerous

Instinct Convention
* table alias
* indenting

## DCL ##

A data control language (DCL) is a syntax similar to a computer programming language used to control access to data stored in a database (Authorization). In particular, it is a component of Structured Query Language (SQL). Examples of DCL commands include: GRANT to allow specified users to perform specified tasks.


## TRANSACTIONS ##

```
Begin Transaction;
..DO SQL..
Rollback Transaction;
```

## STORED PROCEDURES ##



## FUNCTIONS ##

```
ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[fn_GetDateIDByDate](@date datetime) Returns int With SCHEMABINDING as Begin
	Return (CASE when @date Is Null Then Null Else CAST(CONVERT(nvarchar, @date, 112) as int) End);
End;
```

## COLLATION ##

Collation refers to a set of rules that determine how data is sorted and compared. Character data is sorted using rules that define the correct character sequence, with options for specifying case-sensitivity, accent marks, kana character types and character width.

[Reference](https://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/3302341/SQL-Server-and-Collation.htm)

```
Create table Mytable (
[colu] char(10) COLLATE Albanian_CI_AI_KS_WS NULL,
[Maydate] [char] (8) COLLATE Korean_Wansung_Unicode_CS_AS_KS NOT NULL,
[Risk_Rating] [char] (2) COLLATE SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS NOT NULL 
)
```
