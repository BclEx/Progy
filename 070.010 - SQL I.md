## SQL I - BASIC ## 

Prerequisites: [DATA](000.010+-+DATA), [DATA SHAPE](000.011+-+DATA+SHAPE), [LANGUAGE](010.000+-+LANGUAGE).

Glossary:
  - Technical debt - the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
  - RDBMS - Relational Database Management System
  - CRUD - Create Read Update Delete
  - ACID - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
  - DDL - Data Definition Language : CREATE, ALTER
  - DML - Data Manipulation Language : INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

## LIGHT DATA STRUCTURES ##

**BINARY TREE** - left, right pointers
**BTREE** - many pointers


## CONTEXT ##

From scratch using data structures, adds technical debt.
What about
- Recoverability - Backup and Restore
- Efficiency - Faster data access
- Volatility and Scale - Rollbacks, Federation
- Concurrency - multiple threads concurently accessing same data
- Durability - Power outages in middle of operation
- Plasticity - Change the schema

## LANGUAGE ##
SQL is a set language
DML and DDL
Set like the army, instead of a recipe
Set types:
- inner
- outer
- left
- right
- full join
- cross join
- cross apply
Transact-SQL
